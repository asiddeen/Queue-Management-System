# Queue-Management-System

This application simulates a basic customer queuing system. When the "add customer" button is clicked a modal form is loaded

which allows you to enter the customer information. When the submit button is clicked, the submitted information are sent to the

database. The submitted information are also displayed on a nicely formatted table.


This application was designed using PHP, Jquery, MYSQL and Boostrap CSS framework.

I used PHP mainly because it's faster than most programming languages. It makes your site more dynamic and also it can easily be
interfaced with MYSQL.

Jquery is a JavaScript library. It's easier to use and requires less line of code compared to using plain JavaScript.

MYSQL was used create database used in storing and retrieving customer information before displaying them on a table.

Bootstrap is a css framework that is very easy to use and understand. It's also responsive and helps maintains consistency on
site.
